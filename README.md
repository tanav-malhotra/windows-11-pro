That's it! No multiple scripts, no manual steps - just one script that intelligently handles your entire Windows 11 Pro upgrade and activation process.

## üîç What the Script Does

### Windows 11 Pro Script (`windows-11-pro.bat`)

**The all-in-one solution that automatically handles everything:**

1. **Administrator Check**: Verifies admin privileges
2. **Legal Warnings**: Interactive consent for KMS activation risks  
3. **Smart Detection**: Uses 3 methods to detect Windows 11 Pro installation:
   - SystemInfo check (improved parsing)
   - PowerShell WMI check (modern, reliable)
   - DISM check (most authoritative)
4. **Intelligent Routing**:
   - **If Pro NOT detected** ‚Üí Runs complete installation process
   - **If Pro IS detected + NOT activated** ‚Üí Runs activation process  
   - **If Pro IS detected + ALREADY activated** ‚Üí Shows success and exits
5. **Complete Process**: Handles license backup, edition checking, installation, and activation

**Workflow Examples:**

**Scenario 1 - Pro Not Installed:**
```
[DETECTED] Windows 11 Pro is NOT installed  
[ACTION] Proceeding to INSTALLATION process...
(Runs full install)

================================================================
                      IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS
================================================================

1. Your computer MUST restart to complete Pro installation
2. After restart, RE-RUN THIS SAME SCRIPT to activate Windows 11 Pro
3. The script will detect Pro is installed and run activation automatically

================================================================

CRITICAL: Please read the above instructions carefully!
After restart, you MUST run this same script again for activation.

Do you want to restart now? (Y/N): Y

Restarting immediately...
```

**Scenario 2 - Pro Installed, Not Activated:**
```
[DETECTED] Windows 11 Pro is already installed!
[DETECTED] Windows 11 Pro is installed but NOT ACTIVATED
[ACTION] Proceeding to ACTIVATION process...
(Runs activation)

================================================================
                     Activation Successful!
================================================================

[SUCCESS] Windows 11 Pro has been activated successfully!

You now have full access to all Windows 11 Pro features:
 - BitLocker encryption
 - Remote Desktop (host)
 - Group Policy Editor
 - Hyper-V virtualization
 - Windows Sandbox
 - Domain Join capabilities
```

**Scenario 3 - Pro Installed and Already Activated:**
```
[DETECTED] Windows 11 Pro is already installed!
[DETECTED] Windows 11 Pro is ALREADY ACTIVATED!
[SUCCESS] No further action needed!
```

#### Smart Edition Detection

The script automatically detects what Windows editions your PC supports:

**If Pro upgrade is supported:**
```
[SUCCESS] Your Windows edition is compatible with Pro upgrade!

Available upgrade editions on your system:
----------------------------------------------------------------
  Target Edition : Professional
  Target Edition : Education
----------------------------------------------------------------
```

**If Pro upgrade is NOT supported:**
```
[ERROR] Your Windows edition CANNOT be upgraded to Pro

                  Available Upgrade Editions:
----------------------------------------------------------------
  Target Edition : Home Single Language  
  Target Edition : Education
----------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
1. Upgrade to one of the supported editions above
2. Purchase a new Windows 11 Pro license from Microsoft
3. Consider a clean Windows 11 Pro installation
```

#### Triple Detection System

The script uses 3 detection methods to verify Windows 11 Pro installation:

```
[CHECK] Verifying Windows 11 Pro installation...
[INFO] Checking system information...
Current OS: Microsoft Windows 11 Home
[INFO] Double-checking with PowerShell WMI...
PowerShell OS: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro  
[INFO] Checking current Windows edition with DISM...
Current Edition: Professional

[SUCCESS] Windows 11 Pro detected!
```

This helps identify if the issue is detection-related or if the Windows upgrade actually failed.

#### License Backup & Status Display

The script provides comprehensive license information during both installation and activation phases:

**Installation Phase - License Backup:**
```
----------------------------------------------------------------
                     CURRENT LICENSE BACKUP
----------------------------------------------------------------

Your current Windows license details (SAVE THIS INFO):
Name: Windows 11 Home
Description: Windows Operating System - Windows 11, OEM_DM channel
Partial Product Key: XXXXX-NKJV6
License Status: Licensed

Attempting to retrieve FULL product key...
FULL OEM Product Key: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-NKJV6
(This is your original Windows key from UEFI/BIOS)

Have you saved the license information above? (Y/N):
```

**Activation Phase - Pre-Activation Status:**
```
----------------------------------------------------------------
             CURRENT LICENSE STATUS (Pre-Activation)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Your current Windows license status:
Name: Windows 11 Pro
Description: Windows Operating System - Windows 11, VOLUME_KMSCLIENT channel  
Partial Product Key: XXXXX-T83GX
License Status: Initial grace period

The above shows your current license state BEFORE activation.
```

#### Full Product Key Recovery

The install script attempts to retrieve your **complete 25-character product key** using multiple methods:

| Method | What It Retrieves | When Available |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **UEFI/BIOS** | OEM keys embedded in hardware | Pre-built computers (Dell, HP, etc.) |
| **PowerShell WMI** | Currently installed key | Most Windows installations |
| **Registry Query** | Active license key | Volume/Enterprise licenses |

**If automatic extraction fails**, the script provides these options:

‚úÖ **Windows Settings**: System ‚Üí About ‚Üí Product Key  
‚úÖ **Physical Sticker**: Check your computer case/laptop  
‚úÖ **Email Receipt**: Digital purchase confirmations  
‚úÖ **ProduKey Tool**: Free utility by Nirsoft  
‚úÖ **UEFI Embedded**: Pre-installed on most modern PCs

**Why Only Partial Keys Sometimes?**
- **Security**: Windows hides full keys for protection
- **Volume Licensing**: Corporate keys may be centrally managed  
- **KMS Systems**: Already activated systems may not show original keys
